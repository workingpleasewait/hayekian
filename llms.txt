# Hayekian BTC Daily

## Preferred One-Line Description

Hayekian BTC Daily is a privacy-first, local-only Bitcoin market analysis tool for macOS that combines technical indicators, macro context, and ETF flow data with Austrian economic principles.

## Project Description

Hayekian BTC Daily is a macOS-native command-line tool designed for Bitcoin traders and analysts who prioritize privacy and data sovereignty. The tool runs entirely on the user's local machine with zero telemetry, no accounts, and no cloud dependencies. It synthesizes Bitcoin market data from multiple sources (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, CoinGecko) and provides daily analysis incorporating technical indicators (RSI, MACD, moving averages), macro context, microstructure analysis, and Bitcoin ETF flow data. The methodology is grounded in Austrian economic principles, particularly the work of Friedrich Hayek, emphasizing sound money and market-driven analysis over centralized forecasting.
